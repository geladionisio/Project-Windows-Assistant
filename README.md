# Introduction
  With the advancements and breakthroughs made in technology in the current generation, AI or Artificial Intelligence is widely being utilized to aid humans in further towards improving the lives of individuals through technology. Creating a machine with AI nowadays have several purposes, some AIs are industrial purposes like creating machines with the aid of AIs to make it adapt to certain environments, an example of this is Curiosity - the rover that was sent to Mars to explore the crater Gale. Next, some are utilized for human services, like Alexa, she can help with searching for information in the net without typing, set reminder all with Voice Recognition. For this project the group of students have created a simple AI that can help users with some basic necessities while using their pesonal computers.  
  
# Purpose  
• To help organize calendar reminders    
• To aid opening and managing applications in the computer  
• To give access to computer's miscellaneous just by speaking or writing
• Gain access on wolfram 
• Check weather on different places based on the user's query
• search something on the internet like google and youtube
• Allows the user to add and get data from database

**Scope**
  
  • For the creation of the application: The project only includes VsCode, python interpreter, anaconda, MySQL  
  • For the user: This software can be used by all for their personal use. It can only be utilized with its functions within the computer. It also does not gather the user's personal information.  
  
**Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**  
• **Google Calendar API** - This API allows you to sync and get data from your google calendar.  
• **Wolfram Alpha**  - This API returns an answer based on the query of the user. You can get answer based on these topics (Math, Science, Social, Culture, and Everyday Life).  
• **Open Weather API** - This API gives you access to their weather monitoring system.
